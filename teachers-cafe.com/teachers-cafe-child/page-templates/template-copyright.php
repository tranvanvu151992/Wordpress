                <h5>Copyright & Trademark Policies</h5>
                <p>At Teachers-Cafe, we respect the intellectual property rights of others, and we ask that our users do the same. We’ve established the following intellectual property infringement policy in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other applicable laws. If we receive a valid infringement Notice from a copyright or trademark owner that meets all of the requirements listed below, we comply with the law and remove the content from our site. As a service provider hosting content produced by our community, T-CAFE isn’t in a position to make legal judgment calls or resource comparisons, so we often have to rely on formal Notices to take action.</p>
                <p>If we find that a member of our site has violated this policy repeatedly or egregiously, we’ll close that user’s store, and we may take further action.</p>
                <p>This policy provides instructions on how to submit a formal Notice. If you have any other questions or concerns about our service or policies, please contact us and a member of our support team will get to back to you. Keep in mind that T-CAFE can’t offer you legal advice or guidance, so if you have questions about your resources, copyright or trademark law, fair use exceptions, or the like, we encourage you to discuss them with an attorney.</p>

                <h5>BEFORE YOU GET STARTED...</h5>
                <p>Here are some very general definitions that you may find helpful. They should in no way be interpreted as legal advice — Thanks!</p>
                <ul class="outside">
                    <li><strong>Intellectual Property</strong> is an umbrella term that encompasses trademark, copyrights, and patents. This policy covers copyrights and trademark.</li>
                    <li><strong>Copyright</strong> refers to the rights of a creator or author of a unique piece of work to protect against copying, display, reproduction, creation of derivative pieces, and so on.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trademark</strong> refers to a word, phrase, logo, or design used to identify a particular brand as distinct from other brands or products. For example, Kleenex is a trademarked name used to identify a certain brand of facial tissue.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>NOTICE AND TAKEDOWN PROCESS</h5>
                <p>We work hard to respond as quickly as we can to complete notices of alleged copyright or trademark infringement. As required by the law, we’ve assigned a Designated Agent to receive infringement claims. You can find our Designated Agent's contact information at the end of this Policy.</p>
                <p>If you believe that your work has been used in a way that constitutes copyright or trademark infringement in material found on our website, please submit a notice to our Designated Agent. To comply with the requirements of the law, your notice needs to include <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">all</span> of the following information:</p>
                <ul class="number">
                    <li>Identification of your intellectual property that you claim has been infringed upon on our website;</li>
                    <li>Identification of the material that you claim has infringed on your intellectual property, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>an explanation of how the material identified is using your intellectual property in a way that constitutes infringement, AND</li>
                            <li>a description of where the material you’ve identified is located on the Teachers Pay Teachers website, with sufficient detail to allow us to find the material (A URL of the resource page is best);</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Your contact information, including your full name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
                    <li>Statement by you, stating that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the work is not authorized by the intellectual property owner, its agents, or the law;</li>
                    <li>Statement by you stating that, under penalty of perjury, the information provided in your notice is accurate and that you are the intellectual property owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner;</li>
                    <li>Electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright holder.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Making sure you include all of the required pieces of information will help us more quickly address your request. In addition to the above items, it may be helpful to include any additional information to allow us to verify the status of the work you claim has been infringed (for example, a copy of the trademark or copyright registration for the work).</p>
                <p><strong>What happens after you submit your Notice?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Trademark Notice</strong> — If your Notice of Trademark Infringement contains all of the required information, we’ll consider your request and take what action we believe in good faith to be appropriate. To make it easier for us to process your request and ensure that all of the infringing content is removed, make sure your notice is as specific as possible about where your mark appears on our site. For example, by identifying each place it appears in a resource, or in the name of a store or title of a resource.</p>
                <p><strong>Copyright Notices</strong> — We’ll review your Notice of Copyright Infringement to make sure it contains all of the required information. The more specific your explanation is about which parts of a resource you believe are infringing, the easier it will be for us to process your request and ensure that the infringing content is removed. When we do take action on a notice, we reach out to the member who posted the content, forward them your notice, and remove the material from our site.</p>
                <p>The user who posted the content has a legal right to submit a Counter-Notice (described in more detail below) if they believe that the content was misidentified as infringing or was removed by mistake. If we receive a complete Counter-Notice, we’ll forward it to you. Then, it’s up to you to take further legal action to protect the work. The law gives you 10 days to let us know you’ve done so. Otherwise, we have to allow the individual to repost the content.</p>

                <h5>Copyright Counter-Notice Process</h5>
                <p>If you’ve received a Notice of Copyright Infringement from us about one or more of your resources and you wish to dispute the claim that your work is violating the copyright of the notifier, you can submit a Counter-Notice to our Designated Agent. A reply to the email we sent you works just fine. Your Counter-Notice needs to contain <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">all</span> of the following information:</p>
                <ul class="number">
                    <li>Identification of your material that has been removed, including a description of where the material appeared on the TEACHERS-CAFE website before it was removed or disabled (a URL is best);</li>
                    <li>Statement by you stating that, under penalty of perjury, you have a good faith belief that the material was removed as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material in question;</li>
                    <li>Your contact information, including full name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
                    <li>Statement by you stating that: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which your address is located or, if your address is outside of the USA, for the judicial district in which TEACHERS-CAFE is located, and</li>
                            <li>that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Your electronic or physical signature.</li>
                </ul>
